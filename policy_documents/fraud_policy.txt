QuantumLeap Elite Membership - Terms of Service

Last Updated: October 30, 2025

Welcome to QuantumLeap Elite! By creating an account, you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms").

1. Acceptance of Terms
By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, you may not access the Service.

2. The "Risk-Free" Trial
QuantumLeap is pleased to offer a 14-day risk-free trial ("Trial Period") to all new members. You will be asked to provide a valid Payment Method to begin your Trial Period.

At the conclusion of the 14-day Trial Period, your account will be automatically and immediately converted to a full Annual Premium Membership. Upon conversion, your Payment Method will be charged the full, non-refundable Annual Subscription Fee of $499.99 USD. "Trial Period" is defined as 336 consecutive hours from the exact moment of account creation.

3. Subscription, Billing, and Fees
All subscriptions are provided on an annual basis. All fees are non-refundable, except as expressly stated otherwise in these Terms.

QuantumLeap reserves the right to modify or increase any and all subscription fees at any time, for any reason. We will provide notice of fee changes by posting the new fee structure within the Service. Your continued use of the Service after a fee change constitutes your binding agreement to pay the new fee.

4. Cancellation Policy
You may cancel your membership at any time.

To terminate your Annual Membership, you must submit a formal written cancellation request via certified mail to our international processing center (P.O. Box 42, Panama City, Panama).

This request must be postmarked no earlier than 45 days and no later than 40 days prior to your annual renewal date to be processed.

Email, phone, or in-app cancellation requests will not be acknowledged or processed. Failure to follow this procedure will result in the automatic renewal of your Annual Membership for another full year. No refunds will be issued for subscription fees already paid.

5. User-Generated Content (UGC)
You may post, upload, or submit content ("UGC") to the Service.

By submitting any UGC, you grant QuantumLeap a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, and sub-licensable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such content in any and all media. You retain no rights to your UGC after submission.

6. Termination for Cause
QuantumLeap may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach our "Community Guidelines" or "Acceptable Use Policy".

Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. All fees paid are non-refundable. The Community Guidelines and Acceptable Use Policy are separate documents, available upon written request.

7. Limitation of Liability
The Service is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE". QuantumLeap, its directors, and its employees are not liable for any data loss, service interruption, financial loss, or any indirect or consequential damages arising from your use of the Service.

Your sole and exclusive remedy for any dissatisfaction with the Service is to stop using it.
